Just include this line after your `#lang racket` at the top of your Racket program, assuming you have Racket already installed.

- `(require racket/draw)`

- We're getting close to seeing a masterpiece! Download this repo & open DrRacket, [click here to install DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/). Now, open the contents within _2613-Portfolio > Exploratory > Exploratory2_ using DrRacket's file manager.
	- Run the program. If successful, you'll see an ominious boolean value in the console. If it's '__#t__', you're good!
